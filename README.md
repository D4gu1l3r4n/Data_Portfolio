# Data_Portfolio
**Welcome to my portfolio**. 
This repository functions as a portfolio containing some of my work as a *Data Scientist/Analyst*. 
This portfolio is separated into the various projects and competence I have worked on. 
Each project contains a **README file** planning file, a Markdown *(For R projects)* or Jupyther Notebook *(For Python projects)* where the analyses were performed and a summary file summarising the findings. 
Some projects may contain additional files such as visualisation files, models and others.

Feel free to explore each section of the projects!!!
