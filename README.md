# Data_Portfolio
### Welcome to my portfolio. 
This repository functions as a portfolio containing some of my work as a *Data Scientist/Analyst*.
This portfolio is separated into the various projects and competence I have worked on. 
Each project contains a **README file** and different sections: 
like requeriments for the p≈ïoject, planning files, EDA section, a Markdown *(For R projects)* or Jupyther Notebook *(For Python projects)*, finally a summary file summarising the findings. 
Some projects may contain additional files such as visualisation files, models and others.

**Feel free to explore each section of the projects!!!**
